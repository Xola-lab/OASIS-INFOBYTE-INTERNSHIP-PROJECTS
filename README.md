# Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression
(Project 1 Proposal. Level 2.)

### Overview
The main goal of this project is to build a predictive model using Linear Regression to estimate house prices based on certain features.

### Data Sources
Kaggle Dataset: The project utilises a publicly available housing dataset found on Kaggle.

### Tools
Python - EDA, Cleaning, Analysis and Visualisation.
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Sci-kit Learn

### Data Cleaning/Prep
To get a glance at the housing data set, I performed some simple enquiries on the data to better understand it.
- First, I loaded the data.
- Then, I inspected it getting a glance at the rows and columns.
- I then checked if there were any null values
